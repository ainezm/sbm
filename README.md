# sbm

This project is a python implementation of the code in the paper "Stochastic Block Model and Community Detection in the Sparse Graphs: A spectral algorithm with optimal rate of recovery" by Chin et.al.

SMBk_orig.m contains the matlab code provided by the authors. This file works for k=3

SMBk.m contains a modified version of the matlab that works for k=2

SMB.py contains the transcription of the matlab code to python, except it works for all values of k

SBM_dev.py is our work in progress as we modify the algorithm supplied in the original matlab code
